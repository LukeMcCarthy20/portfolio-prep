* Hey! My name is Luke McCarthy, I’m from Cedar Rapids Iowa and I am 20 years old and a software developer. Before I started my coding journey I had a background in customer service, having worked as a server at Olive Garden and handling packages at Walmart. These experiences taught me valuable skills, but my true fascination has always been computers and coding.
Despite my diverse experiences, I found my true calling in the world of technology. I grew up with computers and took a couple of computer science classes in high school which initially sparked my interest in software development. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and Git. Currently, I'm enrolled in school, where I'm not only expanding my coding knowledge but also building connections with classmates and professionals in the coding community.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer by the end of my studies and utilize my knowledge and skills in my future career.
